MongoDB is a NoSQL Database.  It stores data as BSON documents, a binary
version of JSON, instead of table records.  This provides flexibility for
data that is less structured than typical database records by allowing
the data to be schema-less. In combination with powerful Geo-spatial indexing,
the schema-less nature of MongoDB provides an incredibly useful means of
storing location data.

MongoDB Basics, presented by Michael Albertson, will cover how to set up
MongoDB in a Windows environment, the basics of querying the database,
how to interface with the database via the C# driver, and of course a
demonstration of MongoDB's Geo-spatial indexing.
